# Ghostty

Basic configuration for Ghostty. This enables smearing and some tmux settings

This repo goes in your `~/.config/` folder, so that your path looks like `~/.config/ghostty/README.md`.

Ensure that you have Tmux and Ghostty installed. You can install both of them with brew.

You will probably also need a `.tumx` configuration folder in your home directory.
